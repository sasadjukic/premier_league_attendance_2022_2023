<strong>ABOUT</strong><br>
<br>
Premiere League attendance for 2022/23 season is over. This quick repo lists average attendance, max attendance, average stadium occupancy, and lists official stadium capacity for all the clubs in the Premier League.

<strong>NOTES</strong><br>
<br>
Aston Villa, Everton and Leicester City did not provide attendance for Matchweek 38 by May 29th 2023. If I find the numbers I'll update the chart.
